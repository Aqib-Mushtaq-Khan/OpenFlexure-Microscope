# Daily Log – OpenFlexure Microscope

## Initial Stage
- Created GitHub repository for Project Pipeline Progress.
- We collect all data about the OpenFlexure Microscope. We chose the Manual OpenFlexure Microscope.
- We are finished with the Go/NO-Go Presentation, and we have explained the requirements and objectives of our project.
- We are working on the 3D Printing part.
- Read the "Configure and test your printer" section from the OpenFlexure manual.
- Noted recommended slicer settings (PLA, 0.2 mm layer height, no supports, brim recommended).
- Planned first test prints (`leg_test.stl` and `nut_trap_test.stl`).

Hello,
We are preparing to build the OpenFlexure Microscope v7.0.0-beta5 (Low-Cost Version), and we need to confirm tool availability and printing materials at the Fablab. 
We added the Tools list in the file Tools Required.pdf you can see.
Please confirm which of these tools and materials are available in the FabLab. Once confirmed, we will begin printing and assembly.
Thank you!
