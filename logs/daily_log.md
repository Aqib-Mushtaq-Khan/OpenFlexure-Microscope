# Daily Log – OpenFlexure Microscope

## Initial Stage
- Created GitHub repository for Project Pipeline Progress.
- We collect all data about the OpenFlexure Microscope. We chose the Manual OpenFlexure Microscope.
- We are finished with the Go/NO-Go Presentation, and we have explained the requirements and objectives of our project.
- We are working on the 3D Printing part.
- Read the "Configure and test your printer" section from the OpenFlexure manual.
- Noted recommended slicer settings (PLA, 0.2 mm layer height, no supports, brim recommended).
- Planned first test prints (`leg_test.stl` and `nut_trap_test.stl`).
